# A program that generates pixel art of a rose

# 1st step: insert "pip install openpyxl" into the terminal
# Run code:

import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles import PatternFill

# Function to set the dimensions of the cells to make them square
def set_square_cells(sheet):
    # Set column width (0-255)
    column_width = 3  # Arbitrary choice for column width
    # Set row height (0-409)
    row_height = 18  # Based on the formula row height = 6 * column width

    # Apply column width and row height to all cells
    for col in range(2, 7):  # Restricting to columns B-F (2-6)
        sheet.column_dimensions[openpyxl.utils.get_column_letter(col)].width = column_width
    for row in range(2, 12):  # Restricting to rows 2-11 (shifted down by 1 row)
        sheet.row_dimensions[row].height = row_height

# Function to fill cells with specific colors
def fill_pixel(sheet, x, y, color):
    cell = sheet.cell(row=y, column=x)
    fill = PatternFill(start_color=color[0:6], end_color=color[0:6], fill_type="solid")
    cell.fill = fill

    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active

    # Set the cells to be square-shaped
    set_square_cells(sheet)

    # Define the pixel art for the rose (simple representation, shifted by 1 row and 1 column)
    # Each cell is represented by a tuple: (x, y, color)
    # Color codes are in RGB hex format (without '#')
